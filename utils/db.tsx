Luckily I didn’t get bitten and lived to tell the tail. San Rafael is also home to Leo the permaculture farmer who manages the farm in Ritmo Del Rio. For 3 hours a day 5 days a week I planted Lettuce and Plantin, collected grass for mulch and made Bocachi. Permaculture they say is a way of life not just an approach to land management. We made Bocachi by mixing microorganisms, chicken poo, sugar cane and leaving it to ferment for a few weeks. It can then be used as a natural fertiliser for the plants. Being a lifestyle Leo also drinks the micro-organisms as a type of Kombucha. Work was always followed by a swim in the river using Caco as a natural exfoliant and lazing in the hammocks. In the evenings we sat around the campfire, eating homemade banana cake with Macadamia ice cream. ",

        "San Carlos is a beautiful town in the middle of the Colombian country side. A small square in the center and bordered by mountains on all sides. I spent about 4 hours a day doing Spanish classes and then either exploring the town or immersing myself in nature at river or hiking in the jungle. I met a lovely group of people, mostly English but also from the states and Ireland as well. Camilla was my class teacher and made us the traditional Chocolate y Queso (not my favourite). My one on one teacher was called Leon (Camilla Boyfriend). We talked about a range of topics from fashion to religion, and in our final class he took me on the back of his bike showing me the local graffiti of San Carlos. San Carlos, like several Colombian towns, has a chequered past. Nicknamed the town of water use to be responsible for about 20 / 30% of the energy for Colombia in the form of a hydroelectric dam therefore targeted cartel and paramilitary groups looking for control. San Carlos is now a very friendly town and off the tourist trail. All the teachers in Spanish Adventure grew up or lived in San Carlos as so all the locals would greet us with a smile and help us when we buttered their language. Chispas the pet pig Shadow the dog that always followed us home from town were also staples of the Spanish Adventure experience.",

        "The first step on my voyage to freedom from the monotony of a corporate 9 to 5. I sept my time in Medellin exploring the city center on a walking tour, learning about the rejuvenation of areas like Communa 13 away from its violent past dominated by drug cartels to a more sustainable one based on tourism and textiles; largely due to the implementation of cable cars facilitating easier transportation from the suburbs. I was also there during the time semi-finals of the Copa America where Colombia beat Uruguay. On the day of the match  the city was littered in yellow shirts and watching the match in the streets of El Poblado there was chaos when the final whistle below. A street parade of drums seemed to materialise from thin air and the waiters from the bars poured Aquadiente into the open mouths of locals and tourists. On one of the nights I popped into one of the gay bars, Chiquitas ( little ones ). Unfortunately it was karaoke night and latin love love songs weren’t my vibe. Having said that I found Medellin to be a vibrant colourful city that was surprising queer friendly. The Area the hostel was located in, El Poblado, is super touristy and although there are lots of nice bars and cafes I would recommend Laureles for a more authentic experience. Lastly I also went out, evading the Bad Bunny and Karol G to listen to explore the Techno scene, firstly to a rooftop bar called CincuentaCincuenta and then on to a club called Sonorama. I’d recommend both.",
